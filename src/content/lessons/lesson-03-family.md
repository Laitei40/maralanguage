Addressing family correctly is very important in Mara culture. Let's learn the terms for immediate family and the pronouns to use with them.

## Personal Pronouns (My / Na)

| English | Mara (Short) | Mara (Emphatic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| I / Me | **Ei** | Keima |
| You | **Nâ** | Nangma |
| He / She | **Ama** | Ama |
| We | **Eima** | Eima |
| They | **Âmo** | Âmo |

> **Note:** In sentences, you often use the short forms like *Ei* (I) and *Nâ* (You).

## Family Members (Chhâhkha)

| Role | Mara | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Father | **Paw** | Ei paw (My father) |
| Mother | **Nô** | Ei nô (My mother) |
| Grandfather | **Puh** | Ei puh (My grandfather) |
| Grandmother | **Pi** | Ei pi (My grandmother) |
| Elder Brother | **U** | Ei u (My eider brother) |
| Elder Sister | **U** | Ei u (My older sister) |
| Younger Sibling | **Nau** | Ei nau (My younger sibling) |

## Simple Sentences

*   **He he ei paw a châ.** (This is my father.)
*   **Keima ei moh cha John.** (My name is John.)
*   **Nâ nô a tlâh ma?** (Is your mother well?)

## Cultural Tip

It is polite to address elders by their title (e.g., *Puh* or *Pi*) rather than just their name.

## Practice

1. Point to a photo of a family member and say who they are using "He he [Relationship] a châ".
2. Ask a friend "Nâ paw a tlâh ma?" (Is your father well?)
