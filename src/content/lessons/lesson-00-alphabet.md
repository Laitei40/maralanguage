Before you start speaking, you must understand the **Mara Alphabet (Aw)**. Mara uses the Latin script, but some letters have unique pronunciations.

## The Vowels (Sâ)

Mara has distinct vowel sounds. Mastering these is key to sounding like a native.

| Vowel | IPA | Sound | English Approximate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | /a/ | "uh" | Like 'a' in **a**bout or 'a' in f**a**ther |
| **AW** | /ɔ/ | "aw" | Like 'aw' in s**aw** |
| **Y** | /y/ | "eu/ue" | No English equivalent. Like French 'u' or German 'ü' |
| **I** | /i/ | "ee" | Like 'ee' in s**ee** |
| **Ô** | /o/ | "oh" | Like 'o' in g**o** (but shorter/rounder) |
| **U** | /u/ | "oo" | Like 'oo' in b**oo**t |
| **E** | /e/ | "ay" | Like 'ay' in s**ay** |
| **AO** | /au/ | "ow" | Like 'ow' in c**ow** |

> **Pro Tip:** The letter **Y** is very common. Try shaping your lips to say "oo" but try to say "ee".

## Consonants (Dâ)

Most consonants are similar to English, but watch out for these:

-   **CH**: Hard, like in **ch**ur**ch**.
-   **NG**: Nasal, like in si**ng**.
-   **H**: Aspirated. When before a letter (like *Hn*, *Hm*), it means you breathe out through your nose.

## Tones (Di)

Mara is a tonal language. The meaning changes based on pitch.
We use symbols to mark some tones:

*   **^ (Circumflex)**: Indicates a long, slightly falling or high tone.
    *   *Examples:* **Sâ** (Red), **Nâ** (You).
*   **Default**: Short and flat.
    *   *Examples:* **Sa** (Meat), **Na** (Your/To be/suffix).

## Practice

1. Read aloud: **A, AW, Y, I, Ô, U, E, AO**.
2. Practice the difference: **Sa** (short) vs **Sâ** (long).
3. Try saying **Hnô** (Start with a puff of air through your nose, then say 'noh').
