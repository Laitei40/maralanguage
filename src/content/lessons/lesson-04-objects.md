## Pointing Words

| Mara | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| **He he** | This (near) |
| **Haw haw** | That (far) |
| **Kha kha** | That (reference/previous) |

## Common Objects

| Object | Mara | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| House | **O** | He he ei o a châ. (This is my house.) |
| Water | **Ti** | Ti ei do kho. (I am thirsty / want water.) |
| Food/Rice | **Pati** | Pati nie. (Eat rice.) |
| Book | **Bu** | Mara bu (Mara book) |
| Flower | **Pâ** | Pâ a pha ngaitay. (The flower is very beautiful.) |

## Yes / No Questions

To ask a question, often add **ma** at the end.

*   **He he ti a châ ma?** (Is this water?)
*   **Châ.** (Yes.)
*   **Châ lei.** (No.)

## Building Sentences

**[Subject] + [Object] + [Verb]** (Often SOV structure, though flexible)

*   **Ei** (I) + **ti** (water) + **do** (drink/want). -> *Ei ti do.*
*   **Nâ** (You) + **pati** (rice) + **nie** (eat). -> *Nâ pati nie.*

## Practice

1. Touch 3 objects near you and say "He he [Object] a châ."
2. Ask "Is this rice?" in Mara.
3. Reply with Yes or No.
